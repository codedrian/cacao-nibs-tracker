# cacao-nibs-tracker
As a passionate cacao lover with a grandmother who owns a cacao tree, I often find myself harvesting cacao beans and turning them into delicious chocolate treats. To make the process more enjoyable and streamlined, I built a simple JavaScript web application that lets me keep track of the number of cacao nibs I pop out of roasted cacao beans. The application features a button that increments a counter displayed on the page every time I pop a nib, making it easy for me to track my progress and see how much work is left to be done. With well-documented and customizable code, this tool can be adapted to suit the specific needs of any cacao enthusiast. I hope this project inspires others to explore the world of homemade chocolate-making and discover the joys of using fresh, homegrown ingredients in their creations
